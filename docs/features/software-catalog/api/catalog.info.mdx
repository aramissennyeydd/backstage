The API surface consists of a few distinct groups of functionality. Each has a
dedicated section below.

> **Note:** This page only describes some of the most commonly used parts of the
> API, and is a work in progress.

All of the URL paths in this article are assumed to be on top of some base URL
pointing at your catalog installation. For example, if the path given in a
section below is `/entities`, and the catalog is located at
`http://localhost:7007/api/catalog` during local development, the full URL would
be `http://localhost:7007/api/catalog/entities`. The actual URL may vary from
one organization to the other, especially in production, but is commonly your
`backend.baseUrl` in your app config, plus `/api/catalog` at the end.

Some or all of the endpoints may accept or require an `Authorization` header
with a `Bearer` token, which should then be the Backstage token returned by the
[`identity API`](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/core-plugin-api.identityapiref).
